use: Envision the map of multiple possibilities that can inspire new service
  improvements.
reminder: Include people that have a vision of overall service and its problems
  as well as technical roles.
guidelines:
  - step: Start by filling in the the overview of a current state of the service,
      briefly describing the existing actors and interactions. The canvas
      includes both the front- and back-end parts, but you can choose which is
      the most important to focus on in specific situation.
    warning: Ideally conduct some initial overview of the existing process and its
      problems in order to simplify and speed up the session. Involve roles with
      knowledge of both front and back end processes and issues. (Operational
      managers, etc).
  - step: Fill in the related problems, that you are aware of, for each phase of the
      service value chain, think also about the aspects that are not
      problematic, but could be improved to provide even more value.
  - step: "Starting from the steps in the service that have the biggest problems,
      think which AI related solutions could help to overcome them: where
      automation, assistance or augmentation could create the most value. Use
      the AI functionalities cards to learn about different technical
      opportunities and try combining them to generate variety of interventions
      suitable for each service step."
  - step: Once done with opportunities generation, review them all to filter and
      prioritize the most promising ones and proceed with the concept definition
      evaluation their impacts and potential risks as well as the effort needed
      for implementation.

A crucial step to understand how to integrate AI in the service by ideating and mapping out a comprehensive landscape of opportunities that are based on understanding of service needs and inspired by the technological capabilities.
