  tools:
    - Stakeholders Map
    - System Map
use: Uncover existing gaps and identify valuable opportunities for synergies.
reminder: "Map all the relationships as a giving and a receiving: the value is
  in the loops."
guidelines:
  - step: Identify all the players and entities involved in the service supply and
      delivery.
    warning: Search in depth also for actors operating behind the scenes, as well as
      the ones not directly involved with the service but that have nevertheless
      an impact on it.
  - step: Place the user in the center of the worksheet, then start tracing
      connections first with the other players and then among the latter.
    warning: Use different types of line (appearance, colour, stroke etc) to
      represent different kinds of relationship such as information exchange,
      money exchange etc.
  - step: Take a step backwards and observe the map. Do you notice anything missing?
      If you're not just by yourself, discuss about the missing points within
      the team.
    warning: Add erasable hand-written notes or use post-its in order to highlight
      emerging observations and discussions on the map
  - step: Drawing on the new additions, highlight pain points or gaps in the map.
      This activity helps in understanding which aspects need to be improved or
      further explored, and to share these insights with other team members or
      stakeholders.
    warning: Keep visualizing any new detail noticed on the map, for example using
      further colors or dividing the players in sub-sets.

The ecosystem map is a synthetic representation capturing all the key roles that have an influence on the user, organization and service environment. The ecosystem map is built by first displaying all the entities, and then connecting them based on the type of value they exchange.
