  the ideation to them and present functionalities.
guidelines:
  - step: Read through the set of cards to understand variety of technological
      capabilities and eventual connections between them.
  - step: Think in which parts of the service landscape they could be applied better
      to generate most value. Consider also the combinations of the
      functionalities and not just each single applied separately.
    warning: People with the tech background in the team can help to evaluate the
      applicability of some technologies in your service, but remember that
      ideation requires to stay open to a variety of opportunities, even if they
      might seem not much feasible at the first glance.
  - step: Think which possible solutions and experiences in the service these
