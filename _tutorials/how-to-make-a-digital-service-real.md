title: How to make a digital service real?
subtitle: >-
  When you already have a solid service concept and want to bring it to the
  market.
steps:
  - description: >-
      Building a digital service from scratch is not simple: it's much more than
      building an interface that allows user to interact and experience what you
      offer. A clear roadmap (built at a very early stage) help optmize the
      initial investment and start delivering and growing the service
      organically, reducing the level of risk taken. The roadmap starts with the
      definition of an MVP (minimum-viable-product) and all the activities
      required to reach that result and bring it to life. All the service
      offering and functionalities not included in the MVP can be planned for
      following cycles of development and implementation, allowing to reach the
      ultimate level of experience desired and capture new emerging
      opportunities.
    tips: >-
      Include moments of validation at each step, from initial concept test to
      closed beta and open pilot.
    title: Define a strategy for service implementation
    tool: Service Roadmap
  - description: >-
      Document all the features needed to build the MVP and next releases
      through user stories, that describe each functionality in a way that is
      immediately comprehensible for both designers and technical partners.
      Write a user story for each functionality or interaction, and prioritize
      them in order to organize the collaborative process of all the experts
      involved in the implementation of a service.
    tips: >-
      Make the stories simple and contained enough to enable a continuous cycle
      of design-development and QA.
    title: Describe all the features to be executed
    tool: User Stories
  - description: >-
      As the development process move forward, start planning all the steps and
      activities needed in order to bring it to the market, sustain its regular
      activity and fix problems when they occour (e.g. onboarding processes for
      intermediate parties or partners, assistance service for maintenance,
      etc.). Some of those activities are going to be managed internally,
      building specific organization department and roles assigned to those
      tasks, some other could be delegated to third parties, shaping the
      relationship amongs service organization and the broader ecosystem.
    tips: >-
      Don't forget important aspects such as how to handle customer care and
      support, even at initial stages.
    title: Design the internal workflow and assign roles for service delivery
    tool: Service Blueprint
  - description: >-
      Describe in detail everything has been defined in terms of service
      delivery process so that every team member or external party can
      understand how the service works and what requirements they need to
      satisfy. This document is particoularly helpful when you need to onboard
      new partners of collaborators, or assign specific portions of the
      service-building process to external interlocutors (e.g. brief a brand
      agency to design the service identity). The service specifications usually
      include both the description of the vision and most important design
      principles that guide the entire implementation, as well as the detailed
      description of each touchpoint and how they come together into a single
      orchestrated service experience.
    tips: >-
      The more you want to engage others in the process, the more you need to
      invest in project documentation: get inspired from opensource development
      practice.
    title: Document all your choices and reccomendations
    tool: Service Specifications
  - description: >-
      Once the development is almost complete, organize a closed-beta to test
      the interaction with the digital service and refine the implementation.
      The interaction with the prototype helps both fixing possible bugs and
      errors, and collect feedback on aspects that users don't understand well
      or would like to experience in a different way. The earlier you start
      testing the prototype with a closed number of participants, the earlier
      you can identify aspects that need to be refined in terms of service model
      and redesign them before the official launch.
    tips: >-
      If the service is not only digital and a key part is the interaction among
      people and objects in a defined space, organize the simulation as a big
      role-playing game.
