title: 'How to find new exciting opportunities? '
subtitle: >-
  When you are interested in a new field but don't know much about it, and want
  to discover and get inspired.
steps:
  - description: >-
      Gather with your team to generate hypothesis around the needs and
      behaviours of a defined audience group, and ideate on what type of
      solutions could address those needs. Combine existing knowledge around
      that specific market with personal intuitions, clustering the emerging
      hypothesis into key assumptions and initial concepts to be verified during
      the research.
    tips: >-
      Techniques like _what if_ provocations or _how might_ we statements may
      help come up with hypothesis to work on.
    title: Explore brand new horizons
    tool: Hypothesis Generation
  - description: >-
      Plan a field study to discover more about your target audience and
      challenge, validate or refine the initial hypothesis. Building a plan help
      define a goal and set of methodologies for your research, a recruiting
      strategy to find the right participants, as well as key locations and
      timeline. Once it's done, you will know all the logistic details needed to
      conduct the fieldwork.
    tips: >-
      Be creative in your recruiting to engage highly-motivated participants.
      Social networks and online traces may help :)
    title: Carefully prepare to go in the field
    tool: Research Plan
  - description: >-
      The in-depth interview is the most precious technique whenever you are
      conducting a research aimed at understanding user values, met or unmet
      needs and less known behaviours. Write down a detailed interview guide to
      consolidate a structure for the individual interviews, and be ready to
      build on each participant's answers to develop a deeper and deeper
      understanding.
    tips: >-
      Hands-on exercises help better engage the participants when dealing with
      very abstract or sensitive topics.
    title: Turn the assumptions into questions
    tool: Interview Guide
  - description: >-
      When back from the research, map out all your insights and the key
      differences in the behaviours you encountered. You can use personas to
      group participants with similar characteristics and tell stories about
      them, describing in detail their approach, needs, problems, and
      potentially also their existing journeys.
    tips: >-
      Build a four by four map displaying the different personas help explain
      them by highlighting their main differences.
    title: Cluster your insights around user-types
    tool: Personas
  - description: >-
      Translate the needs and behaviours into design opportunities and start
      generating ideas for new services or service features. Building a map of
      all the emerged opportunities helps giving an overview of all the
      interesting directions to work on, and reflect on the overall strategy
      before further ideating or developing one specific opportunity.
    tips: >-
      Print out a big poster displaying the opportunity map as starting point to
      come up with ideas under each opportunity.
