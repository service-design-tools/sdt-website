title: How to validate a service concept?
subtitle: >-
  When you have developed a service idea and initial product but you haven't
  tested it yet.
steps:
  - description: >-
      A service concept may assume different value propositions according to the
      way the underlying product or technology is turned into a specific service
      solution for a defined target audience. Explore each of them as they were
      unique and independent one from the other, envisioning how the overall
      development of the service could support each specific direction. This
      helps elicit several potential scenarios for the service strategy and the
      organizations, to be further evaluated.
    tips: >-
      Printing out each potential value proposition on a single poster could
      help discuss benefits and barriers of each direction.

      In order to make a decision on the value proposition and strategic
      direction for the service, beyond considering the market trends and
      positioning of the competitors, as well as internal forces inside the
      organizations, there's the opportunity to test and validate each of the
      potential value proposition with their possible users. This research
      activity can bring interesting insights around what the target audience is
      struggling with, what could be an obstacle on the adoption of the service,
      how much they are willing to pay for the service benefits, etc.
    tips: >-
      A sample of 10 to 20 participants is enough for this type of validation -
      if carefully selected.
    title: Identify a sample of participants for concept validation
    tool: Recruiting Screener
  - description: >-
      Once you've found the right participants for the validation, show them
      what you have in mind by describing a potential user scenario and
      presenting parts of the service (e.g. mockup of digital interfaces or
      other touch-points). If you have multiple scenarios in mind, or different
      application of the same service idea, take time to explore every direction
      and learn from the participant reactions. This activity is extremely
      helpful in developing service for the B2B market (versus commercial
      products and services), where is often more difficult to understand how
      the service can be integrated into a bigger workflow, and better support
      specific type of activities.
    tips: >-
      Invest some time in clarifying the context of use (before explaining each
      step) in order to put the participant in the condition of understanding
      and evaluating the proposed approach.

  - description: >-
      After the round of validation, report what you learnt to the rest of the
      team. The exploration could be used to better understand the different
      profiles involved, as well as to build some knowledge around transversal
      challenges and evolutions faced in that particoular context. Some of the
      initial directions will emerge as limited or not particoularly
      interesting, while others will probably have found confirmation and need
      for further development. Be honest about the results you find: if some
      bigger barriers that may drive rejection and compromise the success of the
      service appear, it's the right moment to raise a flag and even interrupt
      on-going development processes.
    tips: >-
      Daily debriefing sessions help shaping the emerging directions on the go,
      and building the next session on top of the findings coming from the
      previous one.
    title: Cluster and analyse the emerging findings
    tool: Synthesis Wall
  - description: >-
      Based on the outcomes of the research, one or more significant user
      scenarios may emerge, as a way to consolidate the value proposition and
      approach identified and co-designed with the participants. Describe how
      the service will work across all the steps, from distribution to regular
      use and maintenance, so to turn the initial direction into a tangible
      opportunity and process, that takes into account everything learnt in the
      research.
    tips: Embed organization goals and strategic perspective at this stage.
