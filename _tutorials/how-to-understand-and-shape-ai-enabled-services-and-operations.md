title: How to understand and shape AI-enabled services and operations ?
subtitle: AI is rapidly transforming services, to navigate this change, we
  propose a framework designed to thoughtfully approach AI implementation.
category: Thematic
intro: This process is meant to support organizations in understanding how to
  improve their front and/or back-end service offer with AI, and become aware of
  potential impact. Developed through our extensive research of application of
  AI in service design over the past five years, it guides through a
  step-by-step process with supporting tools to think through the ways in which
  both experiences and operations can get enhanced.
steps:
  - title: "Ideate the opportunities "
    description: >-
      The first phase is crucial for mapping the existing situation of the
      service, understanding its painpoints and bottlenecks and whether AI can
      be a viable solution for them to consider. Use the AI Landscape canvas and
      AI Functionalities cards deck to explore the variety of possibilities
      spanning from the automation of some processes to assistance to workers
      and users, and eventually augmentation of their capabilities and
      enhancement of service.\

      \

      These tools are aimed at generating multiple ideas of intervention, which then can be filtered thinking of the solutions' potential impact and the effort required for its implementation.
    tips: >-
      Involve roles with knowledge of both front and back end processes and
      issues (operational managers, etc), technical figures would be very
      beneficial.\

    tool: AI Landscape
  - title: Evaluate the concepts
    description: Define the details of your concept to better understand what value
      does it bring. Consult the tech team/advisors as well as stakeholders or
      their representatives to evaluate the feasibility and impact of this
      hypothesis. Based on the effort and impact assessment evaluate the overall
      potential of the hypothesis and optional action items to improve this
      idea. Compare initial hypothesis to select the most promising ones with
      which to proceed.
    tips: Conduct research with operators, users and stakeholders to be sure about
      the effort and impact assessment's correctness.
  - title: Define the experience
    description: >-
      Once the AI intervention concept was evaluated and chosen to proceed with,
      it needs to be designed and prototyped in detail.\

      \

      To start with this step, AI Design principles can be used: review them and choose which are the most applicable to the service being designed. By selecting the most pertinent principles, we can decide experience pillars that will shape the future service. After that, a detailed design can proceed with definition of variables of relational and interaction dynamics that can distinguish one experience from another. For this we are working on an AI experience definition canvas, but so far the information about these elements can be found in additional resources.
    tips: Read about the [AI design
      principles](https://medium.com/ai-and-service-design/designing-ai-experiences-p-3-guiding-principles-95b0c745973b)
      and [interaction and relational
      variables.](https://medium.com/ai-and-service-design/designing-ai-experiences-p-2-new-design-grammar-cf779e0c4c4e)
  - title: Assess  the impacts
    description: Though often excluded from the realm of design, this step becomes
      more and more crucial with complex systems adoption and understanding of
      intervention impacts that can benefit a lot from involvement of designers.
      Besides the established practices like service guidelines and others to
      help on the operational level, new frameworks to set up the impact intents
      and measuring protocols are needed. We are developing the AI Impact Map to
      help with this phase.
    tips: Set up the impact assessment protocol as early as possible in design
      process to start gathering the metrics already during design and
      development phases.
