title: 'How to improve an existing service experience? '
subtitle: >-
  When you are working on an already established service and you want to
  renovate it
steps:
  - description: >-
      Analyse the current experience provided by the service, unpacking each
      step in the journey in terms of actions needed, touchpoints involved,
      emerging pain points. Building the as-is experience journey allows to
      capture the overall picture of the service experience and immediately
      highlight the critical aspects that need to be addressed with the
      redesign, facilitating alignment within the organization. For complex
      services, building a service blueprint as a result of the analysis could
      be helpful - so to capture the critical aspects included in the process
      itself and in the relationship with the different touchpoints.
    tips: >-
      _Try it yourself_ is a powerful exercise to uncover details and make sure
      to cover all the steps in the analysis.

      The experience and process are just partial views on the service itself:
      another aspect to consider when analysing an existing service is how the
      underlaying system is structured in terms of components and dynamics. A
      comprehensive understanding of the system allows to see missing
      connections as well as duplications or potential waste of efforts and
      resources. Building a system map helps clarify those aspects to the entire
      team and discuss untapped opportunities for improvement.

      Connect the actors in loops allows to build a comprehensive
      representation, clarify redundances and gaps.

      Before jumping into ideation, take some time to reflect on the outcomes of
      the analysis of the system and experience, and identify some key goals you
      want to reach with the redesign initiative. Goals could be transversal
      (e.g. "optimization of the information flows throughout the entire
      journey") or very specific (e.g. "onboarding: from filling a form to a
      warm welcome"). It's important to ground the goals into a detailed
      understanding of the as-is state in order to set the right approach while
      being aware of potential limitations and blockers to work-around.
    tips: >-
      The desired experience can be defined also as _target journey_, setting a
      specific target goal for each step of the experience.
    title: Set specific target goals to guide the vision
    tool: Experience Principles
  - description: >-
      Come up with ideas that could address all the identified pain points in
      the journey or gaps in the system, as well as capture interesting
      opportunities. The ideas could go from small improvements of specific
      functionalities to broader concepts that impact the entire service model.
      At this stage, don't give yourself any limit in terms of amount of ideas
      or feasibility: capture every single thoughts, share with other team
      members and build one on top of each other thinking.
    tips: >-
      _Rapid-fire idea generation_ is a brainstorming exercise in which each
      individual in the team write down every single idea they have in mind,
      before discussing as a group.
    title: Generate lots of ideas and solutions
    tool: User Stories
  - description: >-
      Collect all the brainstormed ideas and define an action plan for the next
      steps. If the project is simple, it could be easy to consolidate all the
      ideas into a single redesign solution, to be developed in progressive
      steps. In other cases, you may end up with 50 or even more ideas that can
      innovate the current service experience, and it's obviously impossible to
      invest in all of them, so.. where to start? Building an evaluation matrix
      help defining some criteria to analyse each concept (e.g. value for the
      user, cost of implementation, distinctiveness, etc.) and score them
      accordingly. It will help distinguishing amongst very promising ideas that
      could be easily built and bring high value (probably the first ones to
      develop), versus extremely simple concepts that could nicely improve
      certain parts of the service without making a huge difference (low-hanging
      fruits), versus more complex innovation that takes more time and
      investment but will have high impact on the service experience in the
      long-run.
    tips: >-
      The most common axis are value that the concept bring to users and
      organizations, versus feasibility or complexity of implementation - but
      this can change according to the specific context.
