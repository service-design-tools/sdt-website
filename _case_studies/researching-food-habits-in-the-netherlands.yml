  This case shows how diverse private and governmental parties worked together
  in order to better understand the perspectives of Dutch people on health and
  sustainability of food. How to best encourage people to eat more sustainable
  food? Although most people in the Netherlands are aware of the importance of a
  healthy diet, many have difficulties getting their heads around the relatively
  new concept of ‘sustainable food’. Sustainability is often associated with
  packaging and energy usage, rather than with attributes of the food itself. In
  this age of accelerating climate change and a fast growing global population,
  it is important that people more frequently opt for plant-based food, rather
  than meat and dairy. Encouraging this awareness and change of behavior is a
  challenge policy makers and sustainability experts are facing.
insights: >-
  Through the mobile ethnography study the research team managed to gather rich
  data and personal insights into people’s behavior towards food. The main
  insight for the team was that there is a gap between knowledge on healthy and
  sustainable food and their willingness to change their food consumption.
