description: Creating a synthesis wall with data, materials and observations
  from user research is a huge contribution to the design process. The wall
  allows to develop a shared understanding of the research process and outcomes,
  and it's beneficial to both team members directly involved in the project and
  other colleagues just passing by. An example provided by GDS illustrates how
  they have been using user research walls in many projects, included the design
  process of Carer's Allowance. The Carer's Allowance is a service that enables
  individuals to claim the caregiver's allowance online. The research team
  managed to get to a quicker and easier request process by removing 170
  questions (49%) out of the entire form. The wall helped map out all the
  feedback collected during the research and testing, and reach consensus
  internally, meeting after meeting.
insights: When working in large teams, it's very important that the analysis and
  synthesis process are managed in a way that allows everyone to be on the same
  page. The user research wall plays a key role in both leading to the
  identification of patterns and findings, and sharing them with others as
  insights and ideas develop.
