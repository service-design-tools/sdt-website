  Conducting field research in a complex environment like in a construction site
  can be challenging due to its general complexity and dangerousness,
  considering the enormous size of the area to cover and the variety of dynamics
  and behaviors to observe. 


  In order to guide the researchers and help them stay focused in this complex
  environment, it was very useful to prepare a customized notebook for the
  fieldwork. The notebook was designed according to the characteristics of the
  constriction site and helped the researcher to better structure annotations
  without losing time and attention during the visit. The format (printed A5
  booklet with spiral binding) made it convenient to use even when standing or
  moving from one place to another within the site.

  The observation notebook helped the research team to take as much as possible
  out of the observation session, giving a structure that support focusing on
  one element-at-a-time, without forgetting any important data point. It's was
  also useful to align different team members on the same methodology for
  insight collection, and enable multiple research sessions in parallel.
