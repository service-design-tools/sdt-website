  Journey maps allow us to see an end-to-end experience as a holistic journey.
  This tool can help designers make sense of complex systems and processes, as
  well as visualising the more human elements of a journey, e.g. what they are
  feeling at each moment. 

   For one of our health clients, we decided to use this tool in an unconventional way. Typically, it's used within the sense-making phase, after all the research has been conducted. In this case we wanted to use it as a research method itself, getting patients to fill out their own individual emotional journeys to gain a personal insight into their experiences with Cancer and to help guide the conversation around their treatment and post-treatment path. 

   As we had a tight timeline, we needed to think of a research plan that was effective and quick, yet sensitive to our participantsâ€™ experiences and diagnoses. We decided to use these emotion maps as individual exercises within a group workshop with eight patients. It allowed us as researchers and designers to understand each individuals experience of cancer in 1-on-1 chats, but then bring the discussion together as a group to find commonalities/differences within the groups collective experience.
insights: >-
  Through this engagement, we found several pain-points, such as a general need
  for less medical and more layman's terminology and patients wanting full
  transparency and control of their medicine and potential side effects.
  Spotless found that there was a need for communication beyond clinical
  treatments and not only targeting the patients but also to the carers and the
  support group surrounding them.
