  Over a seven month period Tim Bridgham(Blink) was part of the research team on
  a large-scale project that incorporated a diary study over the course of seven
  different waves of participants.\

  \

  Participants were given devices to use in their home and each day, over the
  course of about a week, they would complete activities with the device and
  answer questions using an online questionnaire or digital diary tool.\

  \

  The diary portion helped the team collect valuable quantitative and
  qualitative feedback, enabled them to interact with participants in different
  geographical areas, and helped them to discover how behaviors and attitudes
  changed over time.
insights: >-
  Beyond answering the research questions and uncovering key usability issues,
  the repetitive nature of the research allowed the research team to also
  iterate on how they administered the diary study (as well as the in-homes
  sessions) of this study. That iteration has produced some key “Do’s and
  Don’ts” of diary studies.
