description: Gordi, a young Indonesian company dedicated to coffee subscription
  sales, decided to expand its product catalog and enter the online sales
  channel. Initially, with the help of social media and traditional media
  channels. The products were initially well received, but a year later, sales
  stagnated. Only after a team member had the idea to rethink their value
  proposition (with the help of the value proposition canvas), the company began
  to understand where the issues were. The use of this tool allows companies in
  a simple way to understand their customer needs and design products or
  services that they really want. The canvas has two sides, the company, and its
  users, and the goal as a team is to identify where the gaps between the two
  actors are. For instance, one of the gains that Gordi believed was offering as
  a plus for their clients was a postcard with the info about coffee and
  recipes, but at the end for the clients, those useful postcards became a pain
  because they could not select the recipe when they were making the coffee
  orders.
insights: Gordiâ€™s decision to redefine its value proposition was the first and
  fundamental step in the challenge to uncover gaps in the relationship between
  the company and its clients. Following, an interdisciplinary company team was
  created in order to develop co-creation activities with current and former
  clients. In the end, the results were collected in the VPC finding out the
  gaps between what the company thought to be the truth and what was actually
  true.
