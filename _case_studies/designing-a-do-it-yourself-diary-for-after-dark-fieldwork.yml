  Pulse Lab Jakarta has teamed up with UN Women to gather insights on women’s
  mobility and travel choices in urban areas in order to design practical
  interventions that can improve the safety of women. What does safety mean for
  women when using public transportation at night? What is the travel experience
  like from the time they leave their house, go through transit and arrive at
  their final destination? Among the research methods they applied to help
  uncover insights from women on the ground was the creation of a diary, which
  the team designed to help the respondents record their emotions, activities
  and experiences in transit. It was important to have a diary that can be used
  easily and comfortably, so they tested three prototypes and gathered feedback
  that ultimately refined the style of diary used in the field. The diary was
  helpful for recording the experiences, behaviours, emotions and thoughts of
  respondents, documenting details, which would have been difficult to recall if
  only asked during verbal interviews.
insights: >-
  The diary gave the research team information about the respondents’ travel
  experience which was beneficial for preparing discussion questions for the
  in-depth interviews. With that information in hand, the interview sessions
  were more productive and time-effective, benefiting both the field researchers
  and respondents.
