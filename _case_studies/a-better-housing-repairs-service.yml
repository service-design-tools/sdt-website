  The housing repairs service in a London council was using a number of legacy
  software solutions with over-complicated processes and unstable integrations
  between different IT systems. Unboxed helped them build a new back-office
  system designed around user needs that was able to significantly outperform
  their legacy system.


  One of our key success metrics was an improvement in efficiency. By testing the two systems side-by-side the team was able to demonstrate that officers were able to perform certain tasks up to 35% quicker and with 75% fewer mouse-clicks on the new system.
insights: By creating a video of this side-by-side comparison, the team was able
  to provide very clear evidence of success and get further buy-in from senior
  stakeholders.
