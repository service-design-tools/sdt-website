description: Essense worked closely with the Consumer Marketing team at Schiphol
  Group (Amsterdam Schiphol Airport) to develop a customer experience vision for
  all touch-points of the entire passenger journey across digital and physical
  channels, from buying a ticket to boarding a plane. After a first map of the
  customer as-is journey based on desk research, existing insights and learnings
  were validated and enriched through a two-day ‘service safari’ at Schiphol
  Airport with the respective client ‘area experts’ (parking, prior to security,
  after security). The service safari confirmed lots of the learnings previously
  developed but also clearly showed that there was little synergy between the
  three core airport areas, which appeared as three different silo experiences.
insights: The Service Safari helped the entire team to develop a holistic
  understanding of passenger’s experience and the ecosystem at the airport,
  bringing the findings from the as-is journey to life. This led also to
  additional learnings about the context and commercial playing field (such as
  parking competitors near the lounge, external security personnel, etc.) that
  would have otherwise been missed.
