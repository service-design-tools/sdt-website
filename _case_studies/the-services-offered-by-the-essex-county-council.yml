  The goal of the project was to 'Identify, design and document common service
  patterns to meet the needs of users across different transactional services
  targeting residents (private individuals)'. We had to map all the current
  services offered by the County Council and make the database smart enough to
  spot recurring patterns, technologies, ... . We used Airtable to create an
  Offering Map, that could include multiple layers of information such as: name
  of the service, steps, patterns, role of the council, level of authentication,
  technology platforms, data, data source, painpoints, life event.
insights: >-
  It's an in-depth analysis of the offer to build the most updated database of
  services offered by the County Council. It's about using a SD tool and
  transforming into something that the client will be able to use afterwards.
