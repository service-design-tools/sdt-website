  This case shares how a global Japanese electronics company used journey
  mapping to improve its business to business operations, specifically with
  external partners. Through a number of service design workshops internal staff
  gained awareness of the problem of poor service delivery and became part of
  the solution.
insights: >-
  Here's some relevant learnings derived from the activity and tool 


  \- at first senior management was reluctant to release resources and people's
  time to workshops, but after the first progresses were visible it became
  easier


  \- workshop participants became engaged and motivated and adopted service
  design techniques. Using service design methods, but not labelling them with
  “service design” proved to get people involved.
