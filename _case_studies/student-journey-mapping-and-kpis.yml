description: This goal of the project was to improve retention rates at a US
  university. The team approached the project by first interviewing current and
  former students who had dropped out, then reviewed university statistics, data
  and reports provided by the strategic planning office, and applied strategic
  planning tools to this information. Using the data, they completed a SWOT
  analysis, an action plan, and the “Keep, Stop, Start” framework. Based on this
  framework, they came up with success metrics and created a dashboard with KPIs
  for measuring improvements. The measurements developed by the students
  themselves included actions such as introducing a pre- and post-change survey
  to track the number of students who felt prepared for the quarter system, or
  measuring the percentage of professors that would hold midterms during the
  quarter’s midpoint, in order to understand variability before attempting to
  standardize the exam schedules throughout the school.
insights: The “Keep, Stop, Start” framework and derived success metrics allowed
  the team to assess what was working or not working and be able to improve
  iteratively after executing the strategy. In particoular, students could use
  the KPIs aligned with their strategic priorities to track the progress within
  their journey maps.
