  frog has been working with American Red Cross and other partner organizations
  in order to design and develop prevention solutions to the dangereous fire
  break-outs that often destroy entire informal settlements. In the initial
  phases of the project, the team engaged several local stakeholders in two
  cities (Nairobi and Cape Town) with the goal of understanding all the local
  services and actors involved in the fire prevention and intervention. The
  activity started with a rough paper-based diagram build during co-design
  sessions, and ended up in a consolidated framework, describing the spectrum of
  services sorrounding the individual dwellers and their communities. The map
  allowed to identify the actors involved in the emergency, and the related flow
  of information and communication, highlighting gaps and interruptions.
insights: >-
  By keeping the same structure to look at the fire-safety ecosystems in
  different places (e.g. Nairobi, Kenya vs Cape Town, South Africa), the maps
  immediately clarify similarities and specificities. This helps planning
  programs and designing modular solutions, that could adapt and scale across
  different geographies.
