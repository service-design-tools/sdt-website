description: After conducting ethnographic and design research in Niger, we
  generated solution concepts to prototype and field-test. To plan for this, we
  used a "Rapid Prototyping Planner", a framework that identifies underlying
  assumptions behind each concept and plans the appropriate conditions to test
  those assumptions. For example, one of our concepts was a financial planning
  training program delivered through an existing network called “Schools of
  Husbands,” run by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). So as not to
  fail, the concept assumes that (1) the UNFPA will want to implement this
  program in their schools, (2) the Schools of Husbands existing instructors
  will have the time and capacity to conduct this training, and (3) young men
  will absorb the content of the training in a way that might affect their
  reproductive health decisions. We planned to test this concept through (1)
  meetings with the UNFPA to discuss a potential partnership, (2) observation of
  a day in the life the instructors and a mock training session, and (3) A/B
  testing of different training contents, formats, and facilitators with young
  men as well as testing information retention after a few days.
insights: Using this framework allowed us to be more intentional. While there is
  a general bias towards action in design, and a drive to start “making”
  immediately after ideation and coming up with concepts, this process allowed
  us to plan ahead so that the physical artefacts we created are serving the
  goals of our prototyping and testing phase, as opposed to making something
  "cool" or gimmicky.
