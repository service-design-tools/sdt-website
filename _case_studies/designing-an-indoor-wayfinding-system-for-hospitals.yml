description: Rochester Regional Health challenged Ally agency to conceptualize a
  better indoor wayfinding system for hospitals driven by augmented reality
  technology. Being a highly complex space, such a problem pushed designers to
  consider an intuitive and sensitive end to end solution. They identified and
  visualized key emotional moments in the user's journey in order to craft an
  experience around it.
insights: The approach helped identifying in the first phase of the user's
  journey the need to provideconfidence in exploring the hospital (to find the
  check-in spot). Right after, the second moment needs to provide instead more
  freedom in moving around, as the level of anxiety is decreased after the
  check-in registration.
