description: The Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC) provides services and
  financial support to people with developmental disabilities in the San
  Francisco Bay Area. But for parents of children with disabilities, navigating
  the long and bureaucratic process required to get such services often
  challenges their patience and persistence. The d.school team used
  brainstorming to come up with ideas about how to improve the service. They
  facilitated brainstorming sessions with the GGRC leaders and staff, and asked
  them to create a list of ideas. Even "absurd" ideas were encouraged, and a
  simple joke about driving in a Winnebago to bring GGRC services to where
  clients live became a reality. They reached potential clients in their own
  neighbourhoods and assessed each familyâ€™s needs and decide if they qualified
  for assistance right then and there.
insights: The experiment was not about the idea itself but about pushing beyond
  what was comfortable, experimenting, and discovering what to try next.
  Brainstorming encouraged the team to see the same old thing in a different
  way, and find solutions to obstacles that once seemed unsolvable. GGRC is now
  brainstorming improvement ideas and since then, several new prototypes have
  been launched or will be soon.
