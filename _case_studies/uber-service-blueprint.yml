description: "The service blueprint is a key asset in the hands of designers to
  analyse and bridge organizational and experiential gaps. In this case study,
  WATR explains the value and use of the tools by applying it to decribe a
  service we all know: Uber. The blueprint covers all the elements needed to
  develop a complete picture of the organization and experience provided: props
  (or touchpoints), processes, people, customer actions, frontstage actions and
  backstage actions."
insights: As Uber is a well-known service, it's quite easy for anyone who wants
  to learn about service blueprint and its value to read the table, understand
  the framework and reapply it to specific projects.
