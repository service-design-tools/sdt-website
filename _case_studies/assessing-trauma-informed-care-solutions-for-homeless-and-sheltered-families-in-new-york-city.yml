  There are many criteria that teams can use to evaluate which ideas to take
  forward into solution development. To help with this process of sorting and
  prioritization, the Service Design Studio at the New York City Mayor’s Office
  for Economic Opportunity used an evaluation matrix. The design team was tasked
  with evaluating the current practices of New York City homeless shelters and
  designing solutions to help mitigate homelessness trauma for families living
  in these shelters. The team conducted in-depth research and interviews with
  stakeholders before conducting a co-design workshop to brainstorm ideas. The
  resulting ideas were ranked in the matrix based on two main evaluation
  criteria:


  1. The vertical axis measured how direct of an impact the solution would have on a family’s shelter experience. Ideas with a more direct impact were ranked higher than those resulting in an indirect impact.


  2. The horizontal axis categorized ideas by their ability to mitigate trauma. To evaluate this, the design team used four key principles for trauma-informed organizations. Ideas embodying more of the four principles ranked higher than those meeting only one or two.\

  By using the evaluation matrix as part of their design process, the team was able to identify ideas to take forward towards concept development.
insights: By mapping the ideas on an evaluation matrix, the design team was able
  to visually sort and identify patterns between the solutions with the most
  impact. The combination of the four key trauma-informed principles with the
  evaluation matrix allowed for a deeper evaluation of the service solutions,
  helping identify ideas that were more well-rounded and worth further
  refinement.
