description: "T.Ospito is a non-profit organization aiming to create a welcoming
  environment for caregivers, who come to Niguarda hospital to assist their
  beloved ones in their treatments. During an academic project we hosted a
  co-design workshop to envision an effective and reliable service for
  caregivers, leveraging emotional support provided by local communities (Amico
  di Quartiere). During the the co-design workshop, a set of Issue Cards were
  used to get the idea of the context and understand the mental model of each
  participant: every card represented a keyword (like family, routine, finance,
  exercise), and we used them in a very simple way to engage people in good
  conversations. Having the cards on the table stimulated participants to start
  share thoughts and discuss many things by themselves. They were able to add
  more words on other cards, to highlight missing issues, and finally prioritize
  all of them based on perceived urgency."
insights: Issue cards provide a simple strategy to detect the most relevant
  areas to focus on when approaching a problem area for the first time, by
  allowing to quickly identify the priorities of the user in the context of the
  whole service.
