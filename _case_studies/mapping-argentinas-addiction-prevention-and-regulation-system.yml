project: SEDRONAR
description: >-
  Sedronar held four co-creation workshops with a multidisciplinary team of 7
  public servants and 2 designers facilitating the work sessions. It was the
  first step in their internal processes research, aimed at understanding
  obstacles and difficulties to improve their approach towards prevention of
  addictions. The objective was to gain clarity and develop a deep understanding
  of the entire ecosystem, building a map that captures the key forces and
  patterns driving the system’s behavior.
insights: >-
  The map helped the organization to reflect about (and partially judge) the
  work done so far and highlighted how certain factors influence the system’s
  functioning in diverse ways that are not always taken into consideration.
