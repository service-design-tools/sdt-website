description: Empathy is essential to the design process. It helps us see the
  world through the eyes of the people we are designing for, to understand their
  reality and uncover their latent needs. But how do we empathise with our users
  when we are not physically immersed in their life context? That’s where
  empathy workshops can come in. The Service Design LAB conducted a empathy
  workshop using role-playing with their students ofHuman Centred Design, in
  order to get them immersed in the challenges faced by elderly residents in
  nursing homes. Students were given a short introduction and provided a set of
  personas and scenarios. Using props to set the scene and get into character,
  students interpreted the scenarios, embodying the elderly resident’s
  experiences.
insights: Based on given scenarios and personas, the students re-enact the scene
  where the essence of user's experiences and structural problems is manifested.
  Through role-playing, they gain an immersive learning of the actual
  experiences of users. Role-playing other stakeholders in the service scene
  (e.g. care staff, family members) allow students to understand social
  contexts.
