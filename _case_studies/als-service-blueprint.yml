description: The service blueprint is an important tool to faciltate idea
  synthesis and communication of ideas bewtween stakeholders and to outside
  agencies. In this case study, Pivot Design uses the service blueprint to
  uncover who is affected when a patient is diagnosed with the nerve diseas ALS,
  how and when, and how many people are involved in patient care from a larger,
  service level perspective. With user interviews, Pivot was able to act as the
  patient-voice throughout stakeholder meetings and merge all key user journeys
  into a large servive blueprint to outline a big-picture overview of needs. The
  blueprint allowed stakeholders to not only learn from their findings, but also
  communicate to other agencies the need for better supports and information
  dissemination for people living with ALS.
insights: This is a practical example of how multiple user journeys can be
  translated into a service blueprint in order to obtain a birds-eye view of the
  entirety of a service, and visualize opportunities for an improved journey and
  service.
