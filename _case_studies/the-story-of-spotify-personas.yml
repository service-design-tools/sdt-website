description: Spotify, the music streaming service, wanted to have a better
  understanding of existing and potential listeners. They needed a durable and
  flexible solution that would work for autonomous teams, across the world and
  on different parts of their products. To do this, they created personas. In
  Phase 1, they scoped their analysis to US listeners due to its size and the
  variety of listening behaviours that emerge from the way of life there – like
  long commutes, suburban lifestyles, etc. In Phase 2, they built on the insight
  that listeners’ device ecosystems, physical and mental abilities and other
  contextual factors shape their listening choices. They then arbitrarily picked
  genders, names and appearances that matched the range of people interviewed.
  They reduced the representation of personas to keywords, colours, symbols and
  energy levels reflecting their enthusiasm for music. They didn’t wait until
  the personas were complete before sharing them and tested their asset ideas in
  pilot workshops. The goal was to integrate with their existing practices
  seamlessly. And finally they crafted a communication strategy for Personas
  that included digital assets, physical assets and workshops.
insights: Early in the analysis, they noticed that people’s needs or reasons for
  listening to music were consistent, even in different clusters — that is, to
  kill boredom, to feel productive, to entertain themselves and so on. But what
  was different was their attitude towards music consumption, the value they saw
  in paying for music and their behaviours around devices in different contexts.
