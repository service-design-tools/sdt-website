description: "Discussing about the future strategy of a company is always
  complex. In the context of an ideation workshops about the future strategy of
  a pharmaceutical company, it was very useful to use the technique of
  Tomorrow's Narratives in order to avoid getting stuck into today's problems as
  well as completely forgetting the vision is to suddenly project everyone in
  the future. Stakeholders were asked to imagine job skills and requirements of
  the future decision makers of the company: they outlined the description, the
  educational path, the soft and hard skill they should own in order to pursue
  the internal innovation they imagine for the company."
insights: "The exercise can help clarifying several aspects as well as align all
  the stakeholders' expectations about the future strategy of their company.
  Some examples of questions this activity may help answer to: is the vision for
  the future of the company shared among the different stakeholders? Is there
  alignment around the key value proposition of the new product or service under
  development? How does a new solution fit the overall strategy?"
